# libft
First project at 42

A basic set of tests is provided.
Use : "make test" to compile.
Run with "./test", or "./test all" if tests of bonus functions are needed.
/!\ The results of strncmp may differ if valgrind is used (strncmp of valgrind return 1 or -1 and not the difference between char).
A test for memcmp with an outside ascii-range value was deleted because there was a difference of x256 between the memcmp value and the ft_memcmp value (work fine for others values).
