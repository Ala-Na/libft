# libft
First project at 42

A basic set of tests is provided.
Place the "tests" file inside your libft file (same root as src and include).
Use : "make test" inside ./tests to compile and run only mandatory test. "make" or "make all" inside ./tests to compile and run mandatory and bonus tests.
/!\ The results of strncmp may differ if valgrind is used (strncmp of valgrind return 1 or -1 and not the difference between char).
A test for memcmp with an outside ascii-range value was deleted because there was a difference of x256 between the memcmp value and the ft_memcmp value (work fine for others values).

/!\ Check norme and subject before submitting !
